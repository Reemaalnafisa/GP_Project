    "passage": "The Emperor Penguin is the world's largest and tallest penguin. It is also the heaviest penguin, with some individuals recorded at nearly 100 pounds. Adults have a black head, black tail, and black wings. The underparts are dingy white. The sides of the neck are marked with a large golden or yellow stripe. In addition, there is a varying amount of gold on the upper breast. Like most penguins, the Emperor Penguin has thick, waterproof feathers that cover the entire body except for the bill and feet. Emperor Penguins normally live about 20 years in the wild, though some individuals have been recorded at 40 years of age. Diet: Crustaceans, krill, and small fish. Emperor Penguins will dive to depths of 800 feet in search of food. Most dives last 3\u20136 minutes. Predators: Sharks, Leopard Seals, Orcas. Chicks are vulnerable to predation from South Polar Skuas. Range: The Emperor Penguin is found throughout the Antarctic perimeter. It is the only species of penguin to breed during the Antarctic winter. Breeding takes place about 60 miles from the coast in the Antarctic interior, where temperatures regularly drop to -40\u00b0C. The trek from the Antarctic coastline to the breeding grounds was the inspiration for \"March of the Penguins\". Nesting: Female Emperor Penguins lay a single egg in May or June. After the egg is laid, the female must immediately feed in the ocean. The egg is carefully transferred to the male, who incubates it under a brood patch above his feet. If the egg rolls onto the ice, it freezes instantly. The male incubates the egg for up to 65 days without eating. On cold days, hundreds of males huddle together for warmth. After about two months, the female returns, locates her mate and chick by sound, and regurgitates stored food to feed the chick. The male then takes his turn feeding in the ocean. After about a month, both parents care for the chick until it joins a group (a creche) to stay warm. Status: The population is estimated at about 200,000 breeding pairs and is considered stable.",

After the egg is laid, the female must immediately feed in the ocean. The egg is carefully transferred to the male, who incubates it under a brood patch above his feet. If the egg rolls onto the ice, it freezes instantly. The male incubates the egg for up to 65 days without eating. On cold days, hundreds of males huddle together for warmth. After about two months, the female returns, locates her mate and chick by sound, and regurgitates stored food to feed the chick. The male then takes his turn feeding in the ocean. After about a month, both parents care for the chick until it joins a group (a creche) to stay warm. Status: The population is estimated at about 200,000 breeding pairs and is considered stable.",

    "passage": "The Emperor Penguin is the world's largest and tallest penguin. It is also the heaviest penguin, with some individuals recorded at nearly 100 pounds. Adults have a black head, black tail, and black wings. The underparts are dingy white. The sides of the neck are marked with a large golden or yellow stripe. In addition, there is a varying amount of gold on the upper breast. Like most penguins, the Emperor Penguin has thick, waterproof feathers that cover the entire body except for the bill and feet. Emperor Penguins normally live about 20 years in the wild, though some individuals have been recorded at 40 years of age. Diet: Crustaceans, krill, and small fish. Emperor Penguins will dive to depths of 800 feet in search of food. Most dives last 3\u20136 minutes. Predators: Sharks, Leopard Seals, Orcas. Chicks are vulnerable to predation from South Polar Skuas. Range: The Emperor Penguin is found throughout the Antarctic perimeter.

The rainforest is nourished by the Amazon River, the second-largest river in the world, which flows through the heart of the region. The forest is essentially the drainage basin for the river and its many tributaries. It consists of four layers, each supporting unique ecosystems and specialized species. The forest floor is the lowest layer. Only about 2% of sunlight reaches here, so very few plants grow. However, the ground is rich with decaying vegetation and animal matter, which decomposers like millipedes and earthworms feed on. Tree roots stay close to these nutrients. Above the forest floor is the understory. Like the floor, it receives only 2\u20135% of sunlight. Plants here have large, broad leaves to catch light, and there is very little air movement. So, most flowers rely on insects and animals for pollination instead of the wind. Next is the canopy, where much of the rainforest\u2019s action occurs. Leaves here are very dense and filter about 80% of sunlight. Many leaves form \u201cdrip tips\u201d that allow water to slide off, preventing mosses or fungi from growing.

When it attacks, it bites its prey and shakes its head side to side, using the teeth like a saw to tear its victim. It often swallows its own teeth during attacks.

Their Ampullae of Lorenzini \u2014 special pores \u2014 let them sense electromagnetic fields emitted by moving animals. They can detect voltage as small as half a billionth of a volt. Hunting strategies differ by prey. For example, when hunting seals, they ambush from below with such force that both shark and seal may fly out of the water. When hunting elephant seals, they bite and wait for the prey to bleed out. When targeting dolphins, they attack from above to avoid echolocation. Habitat: Found in sub-arctic coastal waters worldwide, with high concentrations off South Africa, Australia, California, and Mexico. Also found in the Adriatic and Mediterranean Seas. Prefer water between 54\u00b0F and 75\u00b0F. Reproduction: Though never observed giving birth, females are ovoviviparous \u2014 young develop in eggs within the mother\u2019s body. They give birth to 8\u20139 pups, each about five feet long. Maturity occurs at 12 feet for males and 13 for females. Life expectancy is estimated at 40 years, but this may be low. Attacks: Despite fear surrounding them, great whites rarely target humans. Attacks are often due to mistaken identity. They test-bite floating objects out of curiosity. While buoys survive test bites, humans are not so lucky.",

    "passage": "Huge waves, sometimes known as tsunamis, can cause devastating damage when they crash onto distant shorelines. They may strike under sunny skies and calm seas, appearing without warning. Walls of water 20 to 30 feet high can suddenly rise, crushing buildings and sweeping away unsuspecting people. These waves are typically triggered by submarine (underwater) earthquakes. When such a quake occurs, it creates a tremendous shock that disturbs the deep ocean and forms a massive swell. This swell radiates outward in all directions, forming a series of concentric waves, like the ripples caused when a stone is dropped into water. However, these oceanic waves are enormous \u2014 often a mile wide and many feet high. Before World War II, little action was taken to study or prevent the impact of these waves. Afterward, it became clear that earthquakes in places like the Aleutian Islands could create swells that crash ashore with catastrophic force. These waves can travel at speeds of hundreds of miles per hour, explaining how they can hit with so little warning.",

John Billington, a resident of the Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts, was hanged for killing a fellow settler named John Newcomen. Billington had reportedly been quarreling with Newcomen for some time before the killing. Billington was a Mayflower passenger and a member of one of the original families who had come to the New World in 1620. Despite his early arrival, he was known as a troublemaker. He defied authority, argued with leaders, and was even charged with contempt and mutiny.

The murder shocked the small Plymouth community, which had little experience with violent crime. Billington was tried and found guilty.

The island is divided into two parts \u2014 the northern half is governed by France, and the southern half by the Netherlands. This division has existed peacefully for hundreds of years. Saint Maarten was first inhabited around 4000 BC by Arawak Indians, who were peaceful and agricultural. Around 800 AD, the Carib Indians arrived and conquered the Arawaks.

In 1493, Christopher Columbus sighted the island on his second voyage and claimed it for Spain. However, the Spanish never settled it permanently. In the 1600s, the Dutch established a base there to support their shipping routes, followed by the French. The two countries agreed to divide the island in 1648. This agreement has held, though both sides have changed size over the years due to skirmishes and treaties.

However, it is difficult to predict exactly when. Some experts say the next \"big one\" could come anytime between now and 8,000 years from now. The largest earthquake in U.S. history did not occur in California but in Alaska in 1964. That quake measured 9.2 on the Richter scale and caused massive damage. Other major earthquakes in the U.S. occurred in 1811\u20131812 in Missouri, 1906 in San Francisco, and 1971 in California\u2019s San Fernando Valley. Earthquakes are caused by the sudden movement of tectonic plates. These plates make up Earth\u2019s outer shell and are constantly shifting. When stress builds up along a fault line, the energy is released in the form of seismic waves \u2014 shaking the ground. Earthquakes under the ocean can also lead to tsunamis.",
